# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

 Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is one of the fundamental areas in Artificial Intelligence. It is concerned with how knowledge can be represented in formal languages and manipulated in an automated way so that computers can make intelligent decisions based on the encoded knowledge. KRR techniques are key drivers of innovation in computer science, and they have led to significant advances in practical applications in a wide range of areas from Artificial Intelligence to Software Engineering. In recent years, KRR has also derived challenges from new and emerging fields including the semantic web, computational biology, and the development of software agents. This is a graduate-level course that introduces fundamental concepts as well as surveys recent research and developments in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning.

 Topics:
- Discuss the foundations of KRR

- Explain different categories of representation and reasoning tasks

- Assess the tradeoff between representation and reasoning

- Identify which knowledge-based techniques are appropriate for which task

- Apply KRR systems to challenging real-world problems
